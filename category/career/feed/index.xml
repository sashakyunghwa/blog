				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you wait impatiently in line for your <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/577755/this-is-why-starbucks-baristas-spell-your-name-wrong-on-coffee-cups" target="_blank">mislabeled</a> coffee cup (you’re already going to be 20 minutes late to the office), take a step back and think: THIS could be your office. You could skip the commute, bring your laptop and charger, and power through your to do list from anywhere, wherever you are.</p>
<p>Working remotely – whether from home, Starbucks, or another creative place – is booming. A Virgin Media Business <a href="http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/02/22/home-sweet-home-60-of-uk-employees-could-be-working-remotely-within-a-decade/" target="_blank">survey</a> recently predicted that 60% of office-based employees will regularly work from home by 2022. And a separate survey featured in<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2014/apr/30/what-happened-to-remote-working">The Guardian</a> found that ⅓ of employees think commuting will be unheard of by 2036.</p>
<p>But, that’s the future and this is today, you say to yourself. You don’t have the skills or the resources to find a gig that would give you that kind of flexibility. That’s for 20-somethings working on a startup who code in hoodies, or stay-at-home moms who work as part-time assistants.</p>
<p>Wrong! In fact, completely wrong. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=0">typical remote employee</a> is a 40-something college graduate earning nearly $60,000 a year at a company with 100+ employees, according to the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey.</p>
<p>If working remotely tickles your fancy, check out this list of 25 great sites for finding remote work.</p>
<h1>Remote-Work Specific</h1>
<h3>1. <a href="http://www.flexjobs.com/">FlexJobs</a></h3>
<p>FlexJobs has over 50 career categories, with jobs ranging from freelance to full-time, entry-level to executive. The best part? They screen the jobs before posting, so you don’t have to dig through shady opportunities. The site currently hosts more than 20K job listings including part-time and freelance opportunities!<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">We Work Remotely</a></h3>
<p>Sponsored by <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">Remote</a>, the book by famed 37Signals founders, this job board is a catch-all of remote jobs from customer service to web design to programming. With the catchy subtag “Office not required,” and the cache of the 37Signals brand behind it, this site is sure to host remote opportunities at some of the hottest tech companies.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="http://workingnomads.co/">Working Nomads</a></h3>
<p>WorkingNomads (formerly goRemotely) delivers a curated list of remote jobs right to your inbox. Choose daily or weekly emails to make the remote job search come to you.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.staff.com/">Staff.com</a></h3>
<p>Instead of focusing on contract jobs, Staff.com features primarily long-term telecommuting jobs in a range of industries from persional assistants to programming. Choose to work either 80 hours a month (part-time) or 160 hours a month (full-time), and the site recruiters start matching you with employers!</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://www.skipthedrive.com/">Skip The Drive</a></h3>
<p>With a great name, a great resources tab (listing authors to follow and sites to check for help in the remote job world), and a decent listing of remote jobs, this site is true to its eponymous mission. Use what the site provides, you can completely skip that ugly morning commute.</p>
<h3>6. <a href="http://www.virtualvocations.com/">Virtual Vocations</a></h3>
<p>This job board features only telecommuting jobs from technical writers to paralegals. Started by a stay-at-home mom frustrated with the job search for legitimate remote jobs, the company is still run by an entirely remote team. Plus, the blog has great tips, such as <a href="http://www.virtualvocations.com/blog/telecommuting-job-search-help/tips-taking-seasonal-telecommute-job/">a recent article</a> on how to take on a remote gig for the holiday season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Direct Selling</h1>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I’d be remiss not to mention the amazing opportunities afforded by direct selling, also known as multi-level marketing. There is real opportunity with these types of jobs to work from home (or anywhere) and make an income. These companies often require upfront buy-in, so be sure to properly evaluate the opportunity before you jump in.</em></p>
<p><em>A few of my favorites:</em></p>
<h3>24. Beauty: <a href="https://www.avon.com/">Avon</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the best-known and most-storied of the direct-selling opportunities, Avon has built an incredible business on the “Avon Lady Model.” Sell Avon beauty products, from lotion to lip gloss, to your friends and neighbors in exchange for the freedom of setting your own hours and working from home. <a href="http://www.marykay.com/">Mary Kay</a> is another skincare and makeup company that offers the opportunity to build your own business in this way.</p>
<h3>25. Jewelry: <a href="http://www.stelladot.com/">Stella &amp; Dot</a></h3>
<p>This jewelry company has a “flexible entrepreneurship” model for stylists: host in-home or online trunk shows to display jewelry to friends. Flexibility and stye in one! If this doesn’t fit your style, there are several jewelry companies providing this type of remote job opportunity including <a href="https://www.chloeandisabel.com/">Chloe &amp; Isabel</a> and <a href="http://trend-tribe.com/">Trend Tribe</a>.</p>
